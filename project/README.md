###Steps to reproduce our work
- Python is required for our project to run successfully. The recommended version of Python is >= 2.6 or 3.3. If you don't have python, run ```pip install python```.
- Run ```install.py```. This will install all the dependent packages.
- In the ```config.py```, modify the solos, datasets, and cross-validation values, as per your need.
- Run ```tableReader.py```.
- This will generate reports in a folder ```TEMP```, which can be used to do various operations.
- In our project, we are sending these reports to Scott-Knott to rank the solos.
