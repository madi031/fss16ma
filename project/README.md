We are planning to convert the paper, "On the Value of Ensemble Effort Estimation", into reproduction package. We are planning to use nine learners to apply it to the [datasets](http://openscience.us/repo/effort/) and evaluate using the seven error measures, as specified in the paper.

[Paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6081882/).

As an initial step we are implementing and using 1/3rd of 10*9 solos. We are going to run the methods on 5 datasets for now.
