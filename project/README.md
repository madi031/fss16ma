###Steps to reproduce our work
- Python and pip is required for our project to run successfully. The recommended version of Python is >= 2.6 or 3.3. To install python, run ```pip install python``` and to install pip, run ```python get-pip.py```.
- Run ```install.py```. This will install all the dependent packages.
- In the ```config.py```, modify the solos, datasets, and cross-validation values, as per your need.
- Run ```tableReader.py```.
- This will generate reports in a folder ```TEMP```, which can be used to do various operations.
- In our project, we are sending these reports to Scott-Knott to rank the solos.
