The paper can be found [here](https://github.com/madi031/fss16ma/blob/master/project/fss__project.pdf).

###Steps to reproduce our work
- Run ```install.py```. This will install all the dependent packages.
- In the ```config.py```, modify the solos, datasets, and cross-validation values, as per your need.
- Run ```tableReader.py```.
- This will generate reports in a folder ```TEMP```, which can be used to do various operations.
- In our project, we are sending these reports to Scott-Knott to rank the solos.
