## ii. Keywords

ii1. Popularity vs contribution: The influence depended more on the popularity(people with 500 or more followers) of the user than the contribution by the user. 

When a rockstar contributes to the project he owns, he invites more contribution. When he contributes in a new project, it guides the followers to the new project too. 

ii2. Leadership : Earlier there was centralization and hierarchy amongst contributors in github, but no leaders at the top.

ii3. Observers vs participants: They are merely followers and not active participants/contributors of any sort. Participants comment on issues, perform pull request etc. and are a part of the project in some way.

## iii. Notes

iii1. The rate of popular users' contribution did not affect the influence they had on the followers

iii2. Research Question -1: Why do GitHub users follow others and who are the most followed users?

  Reason people follow: 
  
  - Getting updates on the project. Following the core contributors enables this
  - Discovering the new projects and trends. Staying up-to-date can be achieved this way
  - Learning
  - No benefits
  - Socializing. To follow friends/ co-workers
  - Collaboration. To find opportunities to share code
  - General interests
  - Easy access to people - like a bookmark
  
These facts show that influencers can impact easily in the working pattern in Github. 
  
Followers also believed that the popular people on Github are experts
  
Collaboration is more a perceived benefit than an actual benefit
  
Finding new projects/ trends likely not a well-known benefit
  
Reason people donot follow:
  
  - No benefit is seen
  - Busy
  - Following project is more useful
  - Using github for personal use
  - Unaware of the feature
  - Information overload happens
  
iii3. Research Question -2: Are GitHub users influenced by the users they follow?
  - Popular user actions attract their followers to new projects.
  - Followers are likely to star new projects after a popular user whom they are following does any activity on that project.
  - Starring a project is powerful - The contribution showed no statistical significance.
  - The more followers a popular user has, the more their followers are influenced by their actions.
  - The more active a popular user is doesnot impact their influence

## iv. Improvisation 

iv1. The research clearly focussed only on the individual's nature on following and the influences because of this. They can also focus on the project-level followers. 

iv2. They also assumed that the results of the most popular users and their followers can be generalized. However, there is no proof that this generalization is true.
