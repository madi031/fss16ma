##i Reference

Yuri Yuri Takhteyev and Andrew Hilts, "Investigating the Geography of Open Source Software through Github", University of Toronto, Aug. 2010 

##ii Keywords 

ii1. Collaboration - The collaboration forms the key for the Open Source Software. Mostly the distance determines the collaborators.

ii2. Participation - The contributors are not equally distributed. The main developers are few and are concentrated in a particular area. 

ii3. Geocoding - Identifying an account to a location at country level was done which required manual processing at some level for some cases.

##iii Notes 

iii1. The main reason can be as simple as availability of internet access and the economic factors. 

iii2. The core contributors are homogenous in nature as they share common goals and mental models. The core contributors are fewer in number for a project while there is a wider range for the peripheral community.

iii3. The data is taken mainly from Github which provides a relational data in many cases like following, repository watching, code contributions.

iii4. Clustering was done to avoid overlapping region names. Since countries/regions were different in size, the division was made that merged countries and also separated at some level to make more sense.

iii5. Contributors were mostly belonging to the same clusters. 

##iv. Improvisation

iv1. The paper clearly gives proof that location plays an important role in open source contribution. However, there is no statement claiming if it is for good or what has to be done to overcome this state if it is not preferred. 

iv2. There is also a basic assumption that the dataset we have is a good sample. There is no guarantee that the accounts with no information about location also follow the same distribution.
